# Whitelist Contract

A minimalistic application built for the Reach Bear Builder Challenge. A token creator may use this approach to allow people to whitelist themselves for a token airdrop. Find the contract in the `src` folder.

Front-end: React JS

Smart contract: [Reach](https://reach.sh)

Note: The web interface is for demonstration purposes only, and is by no means robust.
